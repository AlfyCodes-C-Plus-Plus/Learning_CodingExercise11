# Coding Exercise 11

In this exercise you will use an simple if/else statement to decide if someone can drive. Let's assume that anyone 16 or older can legally drive.

If the person can legally drive, your program should display, "Yes - you can drive!" using a cout statement. you do not have to provide a '\n' or endl.

If the person cannot legally drive, then your program should display, "Sorry, come back in n years", where n is how many years until the person turns 16 year old.

The age will be provided for you, you do NOT need to declare age. Our test cases will provide different values for age to tet your code
